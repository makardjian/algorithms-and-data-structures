/**
 * Prompt: Write a function called minSubArrayLen which accepts two paramaters - an array 
 * of positive integers and a positive integer.

 * This funciton should return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is 
 * greater than or equal to the integer passed to the function. If ther isn't one, return 0 instead.
 */

/**
 * I: an array of positive integers and another positive integer
 * O: a number representing the minimal length of a subarray >= the second param
 * C: none
 * E: return zero if no solution exists
 *  /since there are only positive integers, if the length of the array is < num, return 0
 *
 * Brainstorm: 
 *  
 * [1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4, 5, 8], 10
